# Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Decision-Tree-Classification
This Jupyter Notebook explores the "Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database" using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about tumor features computed from fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of a Decision Tree classifier for breast cancer diagnosis.
